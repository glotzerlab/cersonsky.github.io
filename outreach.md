# Outreach and Scientific Communications

**A lot of what follows is inspired by my parents.**

My father was a mathematician / pediatrician who did theater at night -- when I was young he would take me to his auditions and we played math games while we waited backstage during shows. **My experience in theater has sparked a love of science communication and outreach.**

My mother is a 5th grade teacher -- together we would brainstorm activities for her students and I (still) keep her up-to-date on exciting scientific research. Unfortunately, too few teachers have access to the world of cutting-edge research, and few "touchstones" within the scientific community. My mom inspired the REACT Workshop based upon the thought: **What if every STEM teacher had a PhD student for a kid?**

**This question led me to create [Research Education and Activities for Classroom Teachers (REACT)][2], a one-day workshop for Michigan teachers focused on providing access and exposure to University of Michigan research across all fields.** The day included [research talks][3] by doctoral researchers, laboratory tours, and activity demonstrations by student outreach groups.

In the three years that I led REACT, **raised nearly $40,000**, involved **12 different university departments and programs**, and had **130 participants** attend from **up to 4 hours from campus**. This event was **free of charge for teachers**, including food, activity supplies, and travel stipends to attend.

This workshop has continued since my departure from Michigan, and was the subject of the peer-reviewed article <a href="https://peer.asee.org/35030" target="_blank">{{"Bringing Science Education and Research together to REACT"}}</a>.

While at the University of Michigan, I also started the Outreach Initiative for the Student Chapter of the American Chemical Society (ACS). This group trains graduate student volunteers in communication to take polymers-based lessons to K-12 classrooms across Southeast Michigan, and has reached over 50 classrooms and nearly 3000 students since its inception. Our pedagogy and best practices were documented in an [article in the Journal of Chemical Education][1].
