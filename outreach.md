## Outreach and Scientific Communications

***A lot of what follows is inspired by my parents.***

My father, Jeff, was a mathematician (turned pediatrician) who loved performing in musical theater and stage productions. When I was young, he would bring me to his auditions, and we played card games while we waited backstage during shows. As I grew older, I continued performing in theater productions through graduate school. <b> My experience in theater has sparked a passion for science communication.</b>

<br><br>My mother, Nancy, is a 5th-grade teacher based in my hometown of Oxford, Connecticut. When I was in high school, my school bus would drop me off at her classroom at the end of the day. While I waited for us to go home, she encouraged me to engage with her class, and together we would brainstorm activities for her students. To this day, I still keep her up-to-date on exciting scientific research, and we discuss how to inject these ideas into her curriculum. Unfortunately, too few teachers have access to the world of cutting-edge research, and even fewer have "touchstones" within the scientific community.

**What if every STEM teacher had a Ph.D. student for a kid?**

**This question led me to create [Research Education and Activities for Classroom Teachers (REACT)][2], a one-day workshop for Michigan teachers focused on providing access and exposure to University of Michigan research across all fields.** The day included [research talks][3] by doctoral researchers, laboratory tours, and activity demonstrations by student outreach groups.

![REACT Schedule](/assets/gallery/REACTSchedule.jpg){:max-width="400px"; width="100%";align="center"}

In the three years that I led REACT, **raised nearly $40,000**, involved nearly **20 different university departments and programs**, and had over **150 participants** attend from **up to 4 hours from campus**. This event was **free of charge for teachers**, including food, activity supplies, and travel stipends to attend.

This workshop has continued since my departure from Michigan, and was the subject of the peer-reviewed article <a href="https://peer.asee.org/35030" target="_blank">{{"Bringing Science Education and Research together to REACT"}}</a>.

While at the University of Michigan, I also started the Outreach Initiative for the Student Chapter of the American Chemical Society (ACS). This group trains graduate student volunteers in communication to take polymers-based lessons to K-12 classrooms across Southeast Michigan, and has reached over 50 classrooms and nearly 3000 students since its inception. Our pedagogy and best practices were documented in an [article in the Journal of Chemical Education][1].
