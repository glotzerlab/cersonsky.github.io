## Hi! I'm Rose. I'm a computational materials scientist.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Computational Science and Modeling (COSMO) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in the stunningly gorgeous Lausanne, Switzerland. As a "COSMO-naut", I work on **methods development for analyzing atomistic simulation data** -- this includes formulating new machine learning algorithms, contributing to visualization suites, and developing open-source software for the materials community.

My work broadly focuses on understanding the interplay between materials structure and properties, drawing concepts and techniques from crystallography, machine learning, and molecular simulation. Most recently, I've been fascinated by the numerical descriptors used to construct models for machine learning -- their physical origins, transferability across scales, and adaptability for learning a broad swath of materials properties.
