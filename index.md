## Hi! I'm Rose. I'm a computational scientist. {#me}

**Starting January 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison!** My group will research ways to numerically encode anisotropy to investigate the interactions at the nanoscale and beyond! We will develop methods and software to efficiently incorporate complex building block design into numerical simulation and machine learning models.


My work broadly focuses on understanding the interplay between molecular and materials structure and properties, drawing concepts and techniques from crystallography and molecular simulation. Most recently, I've been fascinated by the numerical fingerprints used to construct models for machine learning -- their physical origins, transferability across scales, and adaptability for learning a broad swath of properties.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Laboratory of Computational Science and Modeling (COSMO) at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in the stunningly gorgeous Lausanne, Switzerland. As a "COSMO-naut", I work on methods development for analyzing atomistic simulation data -- this includes formulating new machine learning algorithms, contributing to visualization suites, and developing open-source software for the chemical and materials communities.
