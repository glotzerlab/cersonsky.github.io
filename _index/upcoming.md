Come see me speak at this year's **American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)** Meeting in November! I will be giving three separate talks on a broad selection of my work:

* ### [35i - The Diversity of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals for Colloidal Self-Assembly](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/630237){:target="_blank"}
* ### [127b - The Search for Novel Mesoscale Materials](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/629710){:target="_blank"}
* ### [203e - Improving Data Sub-Selection for Supervised Tasks with Principal Covariates Regression](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/627282){:target="_blank"}

Also, come see my posters at [the Faculty Candidate Session](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/639445){:target="_blank"} and the [WIC Breakfast](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Session/48587)!

I will also be presenting work at the fall meeting of the **Materials Research Society (MRS)** in Boston, MA.

* ### [Symposium CH04](https://www.mrs.org/meetings-events/fall-meetings-exhibits/2021-mrs-fall-meeting/call-for-papers/2021_mrs_fall_meeting/ch04){:target="_blank"}
