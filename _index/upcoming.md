Come see me speak at this year's American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) Meeting in November! I will be giving three separate talks on a broad selection of my work:

* ### [35i - The Diversity of Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystals for Colloidal Self-Assembly](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/630237){:target="_blank"}
* ### [127b - The Search for Novel Mesoscale Materials](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/629710){:target="_blank"}
* ### [203e - Improving Data Sub-Selection for Supervised Tasks with Principal Covariates Regression](https://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/627282){:target="_blank"}
